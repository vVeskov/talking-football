                    1.32 metres tall, caused by a growth hormone deficiency.The cost of Messi‘s injections is what
                    first forced the Messis to move away from Argentina, and Barcelona offered to pay for them as part

                    was voted European Player of the Century.FC Barcelona not only employed Johan Cruyff as a player,
                    as a coach, but also took his brain, his DNA, and they applied it to develop new talent.The playing
                    style of Cruyff’s Barça isn’t necessarily right for every club or every country, but it’s proven
                    that is the best.
