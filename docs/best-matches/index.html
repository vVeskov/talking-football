        <span>10. Liverpool vs Chelsea | 4-4 (2008-09 UEFACL 2nd Leg)</span>
        <p>In the five years leading up to this tie, Blues and Reds had faced each other 24 times with
            most matches ending up in highly defensive stalemates, especially during the stints of Jose
            Mourinho at Chelsea and Rafael Benitez at Liverpool.

            Chelsea had a comfortable lead 3-1 from the first leg at Anfield. Liverpool needed a
            three-goal margin win to advance. They took a first step into the right direction when
            Fabio Aurelio stunned Cech from 35-yard wide free kick. Xabi Alonso brought them even
            closer to the dream result when he doubled the lead at th 28th minute.

            After the break, Chelsea scored twice in a span of six minutes (51st and 57th minutes) by
            Drogba and Alex. The Blues would take the lead thanks to Lampard well assisted by Drogba.

            However, two goals from Lucas and Kuyt (81st and 83rd minutes) got Liverpool back on top,
            and they started dreaming again that another goal could put them through. Lampard crushed
            all Reds’ hope to complete a brace and give Avram Grant’s men a 7-5 edge on aggregate to
            advance to the Champions League semifinal.

        <span>9. Liverpool vs Alaves | 5-4 (2001 UEFA Cup Final)</span>
        <p>Before the Istanbul Miracle, there was this goal fest in Dortmund in 2001. Liverpool was
            back in a European Cup Final for the first time since the Heysel tragedy.

            The Reds quickly took the lead on a header by Markus Babbel over the Spanish minnows. They
            doubled their lead a few minutes later when a young Steven Gerrard left no chance to the
            goalkeeper after a brilliant pass by Micheal Owen.

            Right before the 30-minute mark, Ivan Alonso got one back for Alaves. Gerard Houllier’s men
            thought they had smothered their rivals’ resilience when they pushed the lead back to two
            goals (3-1) on a penalty by Scottish veteran Gary McAllister before halftime.

            Indomitable, Alaves rallied to level the score behind a brace by Javi Moreno right after
            the break. Reds legend, Robbie Fowler put them ahead again in the 76th minute before Jordi
            Cruyff (Johan’s son) equalized in the final minute of regulation. In extra time, Liverpool
            finally got the winning goal on an own goal from Defi Geli to cap an historical treble FA
            Cup, Football League Cup and UEFA Cup. </p>

        <span>8. France vs Portugal | 2-1 (Euro 2000 SF)</span>
        <p>
            The two best European Players of their generation, Zinedine Zidane and Luiz Figo, were
            duking it out for a spot in the final against Itlay.

            Portugal took the lead in the first half behind a Nuno Gomes clinical strike. France
            equalized in the second act by Thierry Henry well-served by Nicolas Anelka.

            What exudes from this highly disputed semifinal is Zidane's unparalleled class. The French
            maestro delivered one of his finest performances in The Tricolore jersey, and put to rest
            all remaining doubts that he was indeed the Greatest European Player of his generation.

            It’s only fitting that the game ended with Zidane firing a golden penalty strike past
            Portuguese keeper, Vitor Baia, in the waning moments of extra time to send France into the
            final.
