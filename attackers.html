                    great player.
                    He always had a smile on his face as well. He had skill, scored fantastic goals and put magic into
                    the game.
                    He's not normal, he never has been. He lives in the magnetic spectrum.

                    He was so fast he could score from nothing, and could shoot the ball better than anyone.When he was
                    in his prime, Ronaldo was frightening. He had such incredible balance and power for someone so
                    quick. Played with that Brazilian swagger and scored loads of goals, including some incredible
                    ones.

                    Messi! The name speaks volumes!What he’s doing, we don’t know if we will see another player do the
                    things that he does.Lionel Messi was very small as a child. Nicknamed “the dwarf”, aged 11 he was
                    1.32 metres tall, caused by a growth hormone deficiency.The cost of Messi‘s injections is what
                    first forced the Messis to move away from Argentina, and Barcelona offered to pay for them as part
                    of his contract.The decision seems to have paid off.The rest is history!

                    Johan Cruyff is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in football history. In 1999, Johan
                    was voted European Player of the Century.FC Barcelona not only employed Johan Cruyff as a player,
                    as a coach, but also took his brain, his DNA, and they applied it to develop new talent.The playing
                    style of Cruyff’s Barça isn’t necessarily right for every club or every country, but it’s proven
                    that is the best.
